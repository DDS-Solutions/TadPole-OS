# Incident Response Protocol

This workflow dictates how to handle high-priority production incidents. Speed and communication are the priorities.

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Alert Triggered] --> T{Triage}
    T -- "False Alarm" --> C[Close]
    T -- "Sev-1/2" --> IC[Declare Incident]
    IC --> W[War Room]
    W --> D[Diagnosis]
    D --> M[Mitigation]
    M --> R[Resolution]
    R --> PM[Post-Mortem]
```

### 1. Declare Incident & Assemble Team
- Create a Slack channel `#incident-[id]`.
- Assign an **Incident Commander (IC)**: Runs the call, manages comms.
- Assign **Tech Leads**: Do the actual debugging.

### 2. Diagnosis (The "Why")
Use metrics, logs, and traces to identify the root cause. (See [debugging.md](file:///C:/Users/Home%20Office_PC/.gemini/antigravity/brain/465cc492-80ff-4ba3-a4e3-5706db959613/Tadpole-OS/src/data/knowledge/engineering/debugging.md)).

### 3. Mitigation (The "Stop the Bleeding")
Focus on restoring service, NOT fixing the bug.
- Rollback recent changes.
- Scale up resources.
- Disable non-essential features (feature flags).

### 4. Resolution (The "Fix")
Once service is restored, implement the permanent fix.

## When to Use
- **Downtime**: System is unreachable.
- **Data Loss**: Critical data integrity issues.
- **Security Breach**: Active intrusion detected.

## Operational Principles
1. **Communicate**: Update status page every 30 mins, even if no update.
2. **Don't Panic**: Follow the playbook.
3. **Blameless Post-Mortems**: Focus on process improvement, not punishing individuals.
